# Recommendation System for Safaricom Products and Subscriptions
This repository contains the code and resources for a recommendation system developed as part of a Capstone Project for the Safaricom Digital Academy in collaboration with Moringa School.</br>

# Executive Summary
The recommendation system aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to provide personalized and cost-effective subscription recommendations to Safaricom customers. By analyzing customer data, product information, and pricing details, the system suggests subscriptions that align with customers' usage patterns, budget constraints, and service requirements. This personalized approach enhances customer satisfaction and optimizes subscription choices, benefiting both customers and Safaricom.</br>

# Project Background
Safaricom is a leading telecommunications company in Kenya, offering a wide range of products and subscriptions to millions of customers. However, customers often struggle to find the most suitable and cost-effective plans based on their individual needs. To address this challenge, the Safaricom Digital Academy, in collaboration with Moringa School, aims to develop a recommendation system that analyzes customer data and provides tailored suggestions for subscriptions.</br>

# Problem Statement
Customers may be subscribed to products and subscriptions that are not cost-effective or aligned with their usage patterns and budgets. This leads to inefficiencies in terms of customer spending and satisfaction. The recommendation system aims to address this issue by analyzing customer data, product information, and pricing to recommend more affordable and suitable subscriptions.</br>

# Proposed Solution
The recommendation system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data, product information, and pricing. It compares the customer's current subscription with available products, considering factors such as pricing, resources awarded, expiry date, and budget. If a more cost-effective and resource-rich subscription is identified, the system recommends it to the customer.</br>

# Value
The development of the recommendation system brings several key benefits, including improved customer experience, cost-effectiveness, informed decision-making, business growth, and collaboration and innovation. By leveraging data-driven insights and advanced technologies, Safaricom aims to enhance the overall customer experience and strengthen its market position.</br>

# Project Scope
The recommendation system focuses on analyzing customer data, product information, and pricing within the Safaricom ecosystem. It considers factors such as customer usage, resources awarded, budget, and purchasing history. The system does not have a graphical user interface but provides recommendations through an automated process.</br>

# Workplan
The project workplan consists of four deliverables, including business understanding and objective setting, data collection and preparation, model development and evaluation, and recommendation system implementation. The specific dates for each deliverable are yet to be determined.</br>

# Conclusion
The proposed recommendation system has the potential to revolutionize the way Safaricom customers choose and manage their subscriptions. By providing personalized and cost-effective recommendations, the system enhances customer satisfaction, optimizes product offerings, and improves the overall customer experience.</br>
